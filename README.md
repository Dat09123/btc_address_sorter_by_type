   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Bitcoin Address Sorter. The basic command structure is as follows:

```bash
python sorter.py [options] [address_file]
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-o`, `--output`: Specify the output file for sorted addresses.
- `-t`, `--type`: Filter addresses by type (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32).

### Example

To sort a file containing Bitcoin addresses, use:

```bash
python sorter.py -o sorted_addresses.txt addresses.txt
```

## Address Types

The Bitcoin Address Sorter supports the following address types:

- **P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash)**: Traditional addresses starting with '1'.
- **P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash)**: Addresses starting with '3'.
- **Bech32 (Segregated Witness)**: Native SegWit addresses starting with 'bc1'.
